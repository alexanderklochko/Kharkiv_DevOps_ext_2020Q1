In this work, I learned the basic GIT commands.
Understand such fundamental concepts as commit, branch, merge. 
The result of this task are several simple files. Each of this files were changed; every modification was record with command “git commit”.
Different modifications were made from other branches, for this I use such command as “git branch” and “git checkout”.
In order to see what modification was done I use “git log” and “git status”.
At the end of his task I merged several branches and resolve conflicts.
